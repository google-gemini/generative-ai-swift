# Google AI Swift SDK for PaLM (Decommissioned)

> [!CAUTION]
> This version (`0.3.0`) of the SDK was intended for use with the PaLM API,
> which is now [decommissioned](https://ai.google.dev/palm_docs/deprecation) as
> August 20, 2024. This means that users cannot use a PaLM model in a prompt,
> tune a new PaLM model, or run inference on PaLM-tuned models.

To interact with models using Google AI services and tooling, use the Gemini
API, which is now available in a stable version. For more information on
migrating from PaLM to Gemini, see the
[migration guide](https://ai.google.dev/docs/migration_guide) and the
[`main`](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-swift/tree/main) branch
of this repo to use the new version of the SDK.
